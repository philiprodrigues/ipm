 * Subscriber defines the interface of objects which can receive messages
 * between processes that are sent to topics that have been subscribed to.
 * Subscribers can also be Receivers
 *
 * Implementor of this interface is required to:
 *
 * - Implement the protected virtual receive_ function, called by public non-virtual receive
 * - Implement the public virtual can_receive function
 * - Implement the public virtual connect_for_receives function
 * - Implement the public virtual subscribe function
 *
 * And is encouraged to:
 *
 * - Meaningfully implement the timeout feature in receive_, and have it
 *   throw the ReceiveTimeoutExpired exception if it occurs
